## **Introduction**

Welcome to **Pynon**, your ultimate bioinformatics pipeline to evaluate your work! This tool allows you to easily input your sequence and see the magic as it counts the occurrences of 'G' and 'C' in your DNA sequences.

## **Features**

- Counts the occurrences of 'G' and 'C' in a given sequence.
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface.

## **Installation**

    ```

## **Usage Guide**

1. **Run the Script**:
    Execute the script by running `python main.py` in your terminal.

2. **Input Your Sequence**:
    When prompted, enter your DNA sequence. For example:
    ```
    [+] Enter your sequence:
    GCGCGTAGCTAGGCTAACG
    ```

3. **See the Magic**:
    The script will count the occurrences of 'G' and 'C' in your sequence and display the results:
    ```
    [+] Your sequence has 7 G's
